## Overview

ProximaX Storage offers functional to store single file, regardless of its size, using decentralized network of nodes. Comparing to [drive](features_8.md) where you can store multiple files and folders, this functional can be used when you exactly know what file you want to store, and you don't need to have and pay for unused space (what can happen if you will store single file in [drive](features_8.md), what is also possible).

## Example
