## Overview

Tag is a piece of information, generated from block of data (basically a sequence of bytes which can be created by splitting data into chunks, 'blocks'). They are generated using special algorithm, to have an ability to validate data correctness without having all that data, but sequence of tags, generated from blocks, which are much more lightweight when the data itself. In other words - tags helps you to verify that stored file is the same as it should be without transfering that file back and forth, which increases speed and security of that kind of verifying dramatically.

## Generating Tags Algorithm
