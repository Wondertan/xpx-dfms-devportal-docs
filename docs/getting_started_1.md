title: What is ProximaX storage?
---

## Decentralized File Storage

ProximaX Storage layer is a solution which is based on the Distributed File Management
System (DFMS), that is essentially a peer-to-peer distributed architecture making the
network decentralised and users free from the influence of any third-party storage
provider. It also allows client-side encryption making the data secure. Absence of any central
authority makes the network accessible 100 percent of the time as if some nodes go offline the next
sufficient node takes its place.
