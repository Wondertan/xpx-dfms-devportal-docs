## Overview

ProximaX Storage offers functional to rent some pre-defined amount of space, which you can use to store multiple files and folders, regardless of ther quantity and structure. The only restriction is drive size, but you can avoid that using multiple drives. You can imagine this functionality as copy of Google Drive or Dropbox, but decentralized. Comparing to [file](features_7.md) drive is usefull when you want to constantly work with files stored, delete old ones, add new and change their structure.
