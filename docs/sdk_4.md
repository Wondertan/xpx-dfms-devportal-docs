title: Development Guide
---

A key objective is that interoperability becomes a natural design of the ProximaX-SDK. Follow this guideline to collaborate creating a ProximaX SDK, achieving the best quality with the less effort.

## Development

You can base your work on [Go](https://github.com/proximax-storage/nem2-sdk-go) sdk.


### Before Starting

1. Be sure no one is already working on the SDK you want to create. Check the [repository list](./sdk_3.md), if someone is already working on it, we suggest you collaborate with him/her.
2. Claim the SDK [forking this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
3. Consider using one of the suggested [licences](#recommended-licenses).


### Creating the project

1. Add a README with the instructions to install the SDK.
2. Add a Code of Conduct.
3. Add a Contributors guidelines to help others know how they can help you.
4. Setup the Continuous Integration system. We use [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/), but feel free to use the one suits you best.
5. A project with a good test coverage itâ€™s more likely to be used and trusted by the developers!

We strongly suggest you to do [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) or Unit-Testing (test last). If you need inspiration, you can adapt the same [tests we did]](https://github.com/proximax-storage/nem2-sdk-go/tree/master/test).


### API Wrapper

The API generation can be done with [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). It supports multiple languages. Hopefully, yours in the list.

### TBD all the other from https://nemtech.github.io/sdk/development.html


### Documenting your SDK

SDKs need to be adopted by other developers. As a contributor, no one knows better than you how a determined SDK works. Consider helping others and spread the usage of the SDK by providing documentation.


### Publishing the SDK as official

When you open-source your code, contact us to share the repository.
