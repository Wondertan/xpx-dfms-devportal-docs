title: What is ProximaX storage?

## Distributed File Management System (DFMS)

That is essentially a peer-to-peer distributed architecture making the network decentralised and users free from the influence of any third-party storage provider. It also allows client-side encryption making the data secure. Absence of any central authority makes the network accessible 100 percent of the time as if some nodes go offline the next sufficient node takes its place.

This allows you to create a storage that guarantees the security of files, the transparency of their distribution between replicators and the lack of access for third parties. Also, the storage layer allows you to configure the disk in the most suitable way in accordance with your requirements. One of the main features is that no one know no one, but network know everything and everybody.
