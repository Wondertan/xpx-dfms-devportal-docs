title: What is ProximaX storage?

## Distributed File Management System (DFMS)

ProximaX Storage layer is a solution which is based on the Distributed File Management System (DFMS), that is essentially a peer-to-peer distributed architecture making the network decentralised and users free from the influence of any third-party storage provider. It also allows client-side encryption making the data secure. Absence of any central authority makes the network accessible 100 percent of the time as if some nodes go offline the next sufficient node takes its place.
